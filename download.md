## Zip File

Download the whole project as Zip file:

<p class="arcade-container">
<a class="arcade-btn" href="https://github.com/hyperform/hyperform/archive/master.zip">Press Button for Download</a>
</p>

In this archive you will find the files `dist/hyperform.min.js` and
`css/hyperform.css`. Include them in your project, and youâ€™re ready to
go:

```html
<script src="hyperform/dist/hyperform.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="hyperform/css/hyperform.css">
<script>hyperform(window)</script>
```

## Install via Package Managers

Hyperform is available from a package manager near you:

```sh
# npm
$ npm install hyperform
# yarn
$ yarn add hyperform
# bower
$ bower install hyperform
```

These installations provide you with the same files as the direct download
above.

If you use a build system like Browserify or Webpack, require Hyperform
in your own Javascript files:

```js
// "classic" CJS variant:
var hyperform = require('hyperform');

// or "newer" ESM variant:
import hyperform from 'hyperform';

hyperform(window);
```

## Embed From A CDN

Get up and running quickly with Hyperform by embedding it from a CDN:
[CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/hyperform)

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hyperform/{{site.hf_version}}/hyperform.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hyperform/{{site.hf_version}}/hyperform.min.css">
```

or unpkg.com:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperform"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/hyperform@latest/css/hyperform.css">
```

No local installation necessary.

## Polyfills

For IE 9 and IE 10 you need two polyfills:

* a `WeakMap` implementation. We suggest [this one](https://github.com/Benvie/WeakMap) ([download](https://unpkg.com/weakmap@0.0.6/weakmap.min.js))
* a `classList` polyfill like [this one](http://purl.eligrey.com/github/classList.js) ([download](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/classlist/1.1.20150312/classList.min.js))

[Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/) offers this as conveniant URL, that only
returns the necessary polyfills based on the browser UA string:

```html
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js?features=Element.prototype.classList,WeakMap"></script>
```
