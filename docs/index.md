## Welcome to Hyperform’s documentation!

Hyperform is a pure JS implementation of the HTML 5 form validation API.

## Quick Start

Add Hyperform to your HTML page:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/hyperform/hyperform/master/dist/hyperform.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/hyperform/hyperform/master/css/hyperform.css">
<!-- please load the files from somewhere else in production. -->
```

Use Hyperform in your Javascript:

```js
var wrapper = hyperform(window);
```

From now on you are using enhanced HTML 5 form validation. :+1:

## Examples

See [running examples](../examples.html) that showcase how to elegantly solve
common form problems with Hyperform.
